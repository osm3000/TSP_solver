===================

Advanced algorithms practice project of MLDM first year students
##Description
The objective of this project is to implement some algorithms for solving **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** 
and to provide an experimental study of their running time and the quality of the outputs as well.
##Alogorithms Included
The algorithms developed for solving the TSP problem are:

1. Brute-force approach
2. Branch-and-Bound approach
3. ~~adding and removing edges~~ 2-opt
4. Minimum Spanning Tree approximation
5. Greedy approach and Itrative greedy
6. Randomized approach
7. Genetic algorithm
8. Evolutionary algorithm (Hillclimbing based)

##Installation
